# The net total amount of “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
# Calculate the changes in “Profit/Losses” over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
# The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
# The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
